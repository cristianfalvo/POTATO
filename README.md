# POTATO: Personal Organizer for Tracking Assets and Transactions Optimally

POTATO is a simple application to manage transactions from bank accounts, credit cards and such, as automatically as possible.
It is heavily based off of [Nordigen's example Flask application in Python](https://github.com/nordigen/nordigen-python), and builds over it by unifying entries from multiple entities into one view.
It also (hopefully) integrates other APIs from financial services, such as the PayPal API, using to be defined integration rules.
Lastly, the application (hopefully) allows for the creation of conditional filters and categorization of categories.

As of now, only the month-by-month view is planned; other solutions may or may not get developed.
